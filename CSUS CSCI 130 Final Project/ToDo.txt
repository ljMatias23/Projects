Algorithms
Your project must DO the following (behavior, algorithms):

Be a single screen “game” level (no scrolling) DONE

Have a character that moves in all four(4) directions (up, down, left, right) DONE

Character must have animation equal to that in Checkpoint #3 for EACH direction! DONE

The edges of the screen must be wall images that visually contain the “room” DONE

These images must have bounding box collision detection to prevent the player from walking through them DONE

There must be at least two (2) items inside of the “level” that can be examined when nearby and 
facing the object. Examining is done by looking at the item nearby and pressing the space bar DONE

Your program must display a description of the item examined when a user inspects it DONE

Your program must be free of errors, crashes, or warnings for credit DONE
_______________
Data Structures
Your project must fulfill the minimum Data Structure requirements:

Use at least one of the following Java Collections: ArrayList, Stack, or Queue for image data DONE (arraylist)

Create a custom data type for the bounding box collision object (single bounding box with behavior) DONE

Have a container that holds a collection of bounding boxes neatly DONE
